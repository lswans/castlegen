## Castlegen: A Dungeon Master's Companion Tool

This tool will generate information describing a fantasy setting for your creative purposes
(intended for Dungeons and Dragons). Users can provide input like town size, environment, and
dominant population (from a list), and immediately get a template for a town.

## Update History
# 5/7/2024
Added randomly generated populations configured by inputs, as well as support for primary
"districts" (industries supporting the town). Also began handling secondary flags.
